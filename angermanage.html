                    stock of just how your uncontrolled emotions are
                     affecting your day-to-day life.</div>

                    and count upto three. Consider saying a mantra like "I am calm" or "I am peaceful".

                        Such terms are inaccurate and can make you feel like your anger is justified, which makes it worse.
                         These words can also hurt others who may be trying to help you arrive at a solution to your problem.</div>

                    writing stuff down can help you work out why you’re feeling angry and how you might be able to deal with it. 
                    It’ll also help you to put things in perspective.
