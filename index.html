           <h2 class="homepara1"> Anger is a natural and mostly automatic response to pain of one form or another.
Anger can occur when people don't feel well, feel rejected, feel threatened, or experience some loss.
Angry people always feel that their anger is justified. However, other people don't always agree. 
The social judgment of anger creates real consequences for the angry person.</h2>

<h2 class="homepara2">Anger can take different forms. 
Some people feel angry much of the time, or canâ€™t stop dwelling on an event that made them mad.
Others get angry less often, but when they do it comes out as explosive bouts of rage.
Anger can also lead to stress-related problems including insomnia, digestive problems and headaches.
